## First Steps

You can start by adding one project to your app. Remember that your project need to have data on it.

- Generate or use a project key provided by your app settings
- Add your project to base manager by typing `/add-project <PROJECT-ALIAS> <PROJECT KEY>` in the command bar. ALIAS is a name you give to your app to reference that project
- If you find hard to remember your base names you can add all your base names to a list related to your project by typing `/add-base <PROJECT-ALIAS> <BASE-NAME>`
- Finally display your base data with `/display <PROJECT-ALIAS> <BASE-NAME>` or click in your project list and click in your base.
